## Equations

At steady-state we know the solution:

$$
\delta_{O2} - \delta_{H2O} = f_m \cdot (\epsilon_{pm} - \epsilon_{rm}) + (1-f_m)\cdot (\epsilon_{meteoric} + \epsilon_{evap} + \epsilon_{pl} - \epsilon_{rl}) + m_{strat}\cdot \epsilon_{ex}
$$

Note: all $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ values are for the fractionation of $^{18}O/^{16}O$. The `Dole Effect` = $\delta_{O2} - \delta_{H2O}$.

## Parameters

 - $f_m$ is the fraction of photosynthesis/respiration happening in the marine hydrosphere (vs. marine + terrestrial).
 - $m_{strat}$ is the stratospheric flux multiplier (relative to respiratory and photosynthetic fluxes)
 - $\epsilon_{pm}$ and $\epsilon_{pl}$ indicate the fractionation fractors for marine and terrestrial (land-based) photosynthesis, respectively
 - $\epsilon_{rm}$ and $\epsilon_{rl}$ indicate the fractionation fractors for marine and terrestrial (land-based) respiration, respectively
 - $\epsilon_{meteroic}$ is the fractionation of meteoric water
 - $\epsilon_{evap}$ is the fractionation factor of evapotranspiration

# Information

## Marine

 - gross production is 10.6 Pmol/year
 - no isotopic effect from photosynthesis
 - respiration depletes by 18.9‰
 
## Terrestrial

 - gross production is 20.4 Pmol/year
 - average meteoric water is depleted by 7‰
 - evapotransporation causes an effective enrichment of ~11‰
 - respiration depletes by 18.0‰

## Stratospheric exchange

 - the residence time of O2 in the troposphere is 1200 years, the residence time in the stratosphere is 56 years
 - exchange with CO2 in the stratosphere leads to the CO2 getting enriched by 11‰ (i.e. the oxygen gets depleted)
 - the mixing ratio of CO2 and O2 in the stratosphere is assumed to be the same as in the trophosphere

### Question: What is an estimate of the relative flux to the stratosphere ($m_{strat}$)?

```{r}
m_strat <- ?
```


### Question: What is the effective isotope effect of stratospheric exchange ($\epsilon_{ex}$)?

```{r}
eps_ex <- ?
```

  f_m * (eps_pm - eps_rm) + (1 - f_m) * (eps_meteoric + eps_evap + eps_pl - eps_rl) + strat_flux_m * eps_ex

## Exercise 1: modern Dole effect

Calculate the modern Dole effect based on ther parameters listed above.

```{r}
calc_dole_effect(
  f_m = ?,
  eps_pm = ?,
  eps_rm = ?,
  eps_pl = ?,
  eps_rl = ?,
  eps_ex = ?,
  eps_evap = ?,
  eps_meteoric = ?,
  strat_flux_m = ?
)
```

## Exercise 2: varying evapotranspiration

How does the Dole effect change if we vary the evapotranspiration effect from 5 to 20‰?

```{r}
df1 <- 
  tibble(
    eps_evap = ?,
    dole_effect = ?
  ) 

p_base %+% df1 %+% aes(x = eps_evap) + 
  labs(x = "isotope effect of evaportranspiration [\U2030]")
```

## Exercise 3: varying marine contribution

How does the Dole effect change if we vary the flux fraction of the marine pool from 0% to 100%?

```{r}
df2 <- 
  tibble(
    ???
  ) 

p_base %+% df2 %+% aes(x = 100 * f_m) + labs(x = "fraction of marine flux [%]")
```

## Exercise 4: varying respiratory isotope effects

How does the Dole effect change if we vary either of the respiratory isotope effects from -15 to -22‰?


```{r}
???
```

## Exercise 5: glacial-interglacial time scales

What do you think could explain the variation seen in the Dole Effect over glacial-interglacial time scales? See Figure 1 below from Malaizé, B., D. Paillard, J. Jouzel, and D. Raynaud (1999), *The Dole effect over the last two glacial-interglacial cycles*, J. Geophys. Res., 104(D12), 14199–14208, https://doi.org/10.1029/1999JD900116.
